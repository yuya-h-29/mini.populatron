You have been hired by a research institute to perform the difficult operation of calculating the total population of the world.
Thankfully, various colleagues have already performed a census, and entered their data on a city-by-city basis.

You must now write a node app that reads this csv (asynchronously) and calls a callback with the result.

## Setup

1.  Fork and clone this respository
1.  Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies
1.  Run `yarn test` and observe the failing test
1.  Calculate the total, and invoke the callback with the result to satisfy the test!
